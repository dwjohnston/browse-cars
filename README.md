# acme car browser 

Scaffolded with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

```
npm install && npm start 

```

## Some notes

- Uses react, react-router, redux, redux-thunk. 
- I didn't build a backend, but mocked data fetches by using promises in my action creators to simulate loading the data from a backend. 
- The feature image for the Mazda MX5 wasn't found, so I found a new image. 
- No error handling or tests.
- Some basic responsive design for small screens.
